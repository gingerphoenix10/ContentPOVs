        [h2][b]Installation[/b][/h2][hr]
        [h3]Steam Workshop (Recommended)[/h3]
        
        Since you're already here, the simplest way to install the mod is to just click the green [i]subscribe[/i] button below. The mod will then download automatically

        [h3]Mod Manager (BepInEx, NOT RECOMMENDED)[/h3]

        An app like [url=https://thunderstore.io/c/content-warning/p/ebkr/r2modman/]r2modman[/url] or the [url=https://thunderstore.io/c/content-warning/p/ebkr/r2modman/]Thunderstore Mod Manager[/url] app will let you download this mod, along with other BepInEx Content Warning mods automatically, and split them into separate mod profiles.
        If you've downgraded to a previous version of Content Warning for mod compatibility, install ContentPOVs v1.1.1, ShopUtils v1.0.8, ContentSettings v1.2.2 and MyceliumNetworking v1.0.14, as those are verified to work.

        [h3]Manually (BepInEx, VERY NOT RECOMMENDED)[/h3]

        Make sure you have BepInEx installed on Content Warning, then download the mod zip file and move the [code](ZIP)\plugins\com.gingerphoenix10.POVs.dll[/code] file into [code](Content Warning Directory)\BepInEx\plugins[/code]and the mod should start upon next launch.
        If you've downgraded to a previous version of Content Warning for mod compatibility, install ContentPOVs v1.1.1, ShopUtils v1.0.8, ContentSettings v1.2.2 and MyceliumNetworking v1.0.14, as those are verified to work.

        [h3]Who needs to install? (Is this vanilla compatible?)[/h3]
        
        This mod must be installed for all players, not just the host. May still partially work if only the host has it installed, but that's:[list]
        [*]Not (and will not be) tested
        [*]Will not work correctly
        [*]May stop working from any update[/list]
        It other words, NO it is NOT vanilla compatible. Sorry :)
