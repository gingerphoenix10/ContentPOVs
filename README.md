Capturing Everyone's POV one camera at a time

## Features
- Spawn a camera for every player in the lobby
- Set POV cameras' color to the player's Visor color, and pickup text to show who it belongs to (toggleable)
- Only allow the cameras' owner to pickup their camera (toggleable)
- Display cameras' owner at the bottom right of each recording (toggleable)
- Full [Virality](https://thunderstore.io/c/content-warning/p/MaxWasUnavailable/Virality/) support (4+ players, late joining)
- Compatibility with most, if not all other Content Warning mods
- Divides the amount of views you get by your player count, so the whole crew has to work together to reach quota

## Installation

### Mod Manager (Recommended)
An app like [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/content-warning/p/ebkr/r2modman/) or the [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager) app will let you download this mod, along with all other Content Warning mods automatically, and split them into separate mod profiles.
If you've downgraded to the previous version for mod compatibility, install ContentPOVs v1.1.1, ShopUtils v1.0.8, ContentSettings v1.2.2 and MyceliumNetworking v.1.0.14, as those are verified to work.

### Manually
Make sure you have BepInEx installed on Content Warning, then download the mod zip file and move the `(ZIP)\plugins\com.gingerphoenix10.POVs.dll` file into `(Content Warning Directory)\BepInEx\plugins`. Mod should start upon next launch
If you've downgraded to the previous version for mod compatibility, install ContentPOVs v1.1.1, ShopUtils v1.0.8, ContentSettings v1.2.2 and MyceliumNetworking v.1.0.14, as those are verified to work.

### Who needs to install?
This mod must be installed for all players, not just the host. May still partially work if only the host has it installed, but that's:
- Not (and will not be) tested
- Will not work correctly
- May stop working from any update
