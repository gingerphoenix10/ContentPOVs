## Installation

### Mod Manager (Recommended)
An app like r2modman or the Thunderstore app will let you download this, and all other Content Warning mods in separate profiles.

### Manually
Make sure you Have BepInEx installed on Content Warning, then download the mod zip file and move the `(ZIP)\plugins\com.gingerphoenix10.POVs.dll` file into `(Content Warning Directory)\BepInEx\plugins`. Mod should start upon next launch

### Who needs to install?
This mod must be installed for all players, not just the host. May still partially work if only the host has it installed, but that's:
- Not (and will not be) tested
- Will not work correctly
- May stop working from any update.
